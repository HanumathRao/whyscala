So why?
=======

* Nice combination of Python/Ruby and Java - concise syntax, static typing and access to Java libraries you already have
* Immutable objects, collections **and API to operate on them.**
   `val smallPrimes: Set[Int] = Set(2, 3) + 5 + 7  // create new set with added 5 and 7. And in Java?`
* Concise code, because brevity is a virtue
    * Inlined/Anonymous functions  `val man = people.find(_.isMan)     // same as people.find(person => person.isMan)`
    * Number of [useful methods](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.List) in collection to [solve the problem](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/collections-api/collections_3.html)
    * I write types where I want and where I have to as opposed to everywhere (which produces unnecessary code)
* Less errors
    * Concise code
    * Encouraged immutability
    * Code is checked by compiler (static typing)
* Functions and Tuples are first-class citizens
    * Return many values from a function/method!
    * You can define a function inside a function/method, if this is what you need.
* Hybrid of Object Oriented (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP)
    * FP idioms fit data processing better than objects 
      * Spark http://spark.incubator.apache.org/examples.html
      * Scalding https://github.com/twitter/scalding
    * Pattern matching and dynamic dispatch - [why both?](http://www.parleys.com/play/51c1994ae4b0d38b54f4621b/chapter55/about)
    * Polyglot and Poly-paradigm Programming http://polyglotprogramming.com/talks
* I can operate on `BigInteger` using `+` and `*` rather than `add()` or `multiply()`. [Here is an example](http://daily-scala.blogspot.ca/2009/11/bigint-in-scala.html)
* Java interoperability, so you can use Java classes, like `File` or `Date`
* [Easy to start with for Java developers][easy-to-start]
* No more `NullPointerException`! Unless you invoke Java code :P
* Default parameters and named parameters
* Advanced concepts available, when you are ready:
    * Implicit conversions
    * Passed-by-name parameters
    * Actors, Futures
    * Partially applied functions, Currying
    * DSL

What others say?

Easy to start
=============
[easy-to-start]: #easy-to-start
* You can write Java-style code
* And improve it every day. Read code, write code, ask questions, get excited!
* Immutability is encouraged, but not required
* Some developers could already try [functional programming with Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/FunctionalExplained)
* [A Brief Intro to Scala](http://www.slideshare.net/tpunder/a-brief-intro-to-scala)
* Very similar to Java, you don't have to start with advanced stuff during the first day.
* Tutorials geared for people coming from... http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/
* [Java to Scala cheatsheet](http://techblog.realestate.com.au/java-to-scala-cheatsheet/) by Ken Scambler
* [Cheatsheet. One huge Scala reference card](http://mbonaci.github.io/scala/)

Better code - [Examples](https://github.com/mmilewski/whyscala/blob/master/Examples.md)
===========

Concise code
------------

* Uses compiler (not developer) to generate boilerplate
    ```scala
    class Person(val name: String)
  
    val p = new Person("Marcin")
    p.name              // Marcin
    p.name = "John"     // name is read-only. If you need write-access, change val to var in class definition
    ```
    Let compiler create getters/setters for you!
    ```scala
    class Person(@BeanProperty val name: String)
  
    val p = new Person("Marcin")
    p.name                 // Marcin
    p.getName              // Marcin
    ```

Fewer bugs
----------
* Wrong placeholders or mismatching number of placeholders
   ```java
   String serviceName = "translator";
   int failures = 4;

   // When formatting String you should use %s, %d and so on
   logger.info(String.format("%s failed %d times.", serviceName, failures));
   
   // But you can also use slf4j's formatter... but the usage is different
   logger.info("{} failed {} times.", serviceName, failures);
   
   // 1. If you mix these two usages, your messages becomes useless.
   // 2. If you provide wrong number of arguments, you are in trouble.
   ```
   ```scala
   // In Scala mechanism for String formatting averts both issues
   val serviceName: String = "translator"
   val failures: Int = 4
   logger.info(s"${serviceName} failed ${failures} times")

   ```

Access to Java libraries is easy
================================

```scala
import java.util.Date
val today = new Date()                  // Brackets are optional
```
